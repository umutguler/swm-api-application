# How to start app

## Requirements

Make sure you have:

-   [dotnet cli](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - I've used the latest .NET 5.

## Installation

You may need to run a dotnet restore for packages to install.

## Usage
You can use VSCode, it has a launch.json ready for you to pick a profile.
Or Visual Studio IDE, also has profiles to launch in different modes.
